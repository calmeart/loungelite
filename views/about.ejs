      <p class="mb-3">This is the page that you have just seen. Unfortunately, while the social authentication buttons work as intented, they only allow test accounts to validate while the application is in development state. But you can very easily create an account.</p>
      <img class="aboutImage mb-3" src="images/register.jpg" alt="register screen">
      <p class="mb-5">This is as easy as it gets. Creating an account is so simple it practically doesn't exist. It only needs an username and password. Don't forget your password tough, there is no method to retrieve it.</p>
      <p class="mb-3">When an account is created, you will be redirected to your page. From this page you can create posts and you can create stacks.</p>

      <p>Creating a post: Apart from title and body, the two properties that available are post visibility and stacks. Visibility can be public or private. And stacks is just the category that your post will be visible under.</p>
      <p class="mb-5">Creating a stack: All the posts are under General stack by default. You can add stacks by pressing the + button next to stacks.</p>
